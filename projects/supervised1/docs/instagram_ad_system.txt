Problem: Design ad serving system for instagram 

Step 1: Gather requirements:
    
    To understand the system
    - Do we have an existing system to serve ads ? What are its capabilities ? 
    - Are all the ads managed within the system or there are any third-party ads ?
    Existing system which doesn't use any machine Learning
    we have implicit labeling data
    
    
    To understand business goal:
    - What are some of the issues with the current system from business stand point ?
    - What is our business goal ? Improve CTRs ?
    - What is the ad revenue model ? Does the company get money on clicks or is there a costing to advertise ? Is it by location on the site ? 
        (bid for impressions, clicks, and Conversions)
    - What is the criteria to pick an ad other than relevancy ?
    - Any considerations we need to make to show new ads vs relevant ads, other than the goal of improving the CTR ? (room for exploration)
    - Do we nee any interpretability on why a particular ad is shown ?

    To understand data we have:
    - What are the ads of - images, videos, carousel of images, etc.. ?
        image, video
    - What do we collect as part of the ad ? - target audience attributes ? what is the ad about ? any placement information of the ad ?
        content, monetary value on click, company name, product name, description of the ad (text)
    - Based on my knowledge, ads are targeted to specific locations on the site ? What information we have about these locations - location costing, performance by device, etc. ?  Typically we want the locations to be pre-defined so we don't hinder the overall user experience with the app. This could be modeled as a different system. Can we assume we have this in place ?
    - What information we have on users and their activity ?
        all user interactions - posts, likes, impressions, ads clicked, ads impressions

    To understand scale:
    - What is our user base and what is the active daily count ?
    1 B users and 100M daily active users
    - How many campaigns are run actively at a time in the current system ?
    100,000 x 10 ads
    - How many ads are typically targeted on load of the page ? ( every 3 for 2 )
    - How critical is for a new ad to show up immediately from publish date ? (ad relevancy vs ad bid)
    - Whats the latency we are targeting ?

    Requirements:
        - Increase reveneue while not alienating the users.
        - User scrolls their instagram feed, periodicaly, instead of natural post, there is an ad
        - Rank which ads show to the user
        - Ads are videos or images with some caption text
        - 1 billion users
        - visit once per day
        - 100ms per decision
        - User data - demographics, history, likes, posts, comments
        - Ad data - image / video / text, historical CTR, bid
        - lots of implicit data (actual clicks of past ad campaigns)
        - Minimal explicit data where human ranked ad quality

Step 2: Define Metrics:
    Online Metrics:
    - Click through rate
    - Conversions
    - Impressions (for awareness ads)

    - Time spent on instagram, engagement with Instagram (#likes or #comments)
    - Showing ads vs engagement
        clicking ad makes user leave instagram
        less active users implies less ad reveneue

    Offline Metrics:
    - Precision / Recall / F1 score / Accuracy of ad CTR or conversion
    - Reciprocal rank
    - NDCG
    - Q: How do we measure Impressions ?
    - Q: trade-off between most ranked vs ranked highest bid ?


Step 3: High Level System Architecture
    - models
        Candidate Ads (candidate generation, offline system)
        Ad Ranker (accounts for latest user activity and ranks the relevant ads, should be trained more frequent, online system)

    - Model Training
        Training data generation (user activity, users, ads, Feature store)
        Candidate Ads Model
        Ad Ranker Model
        Model repository
    - Model inference
        Candidate Ads
        Ad Ranker
        Feature store
        API

Step 4: System Component Building
    Data:
        User:
            - demographics
            - profile
            - activity (time spent on instagram, interactive-ness, interests)
        Ad:
            - image: create embedding
            - video: sample few frames, create image emeddings and average over it
            - text: use some sentence embedding 
        user-ad activty:
            - user - ad clicks / conversions for positive data
            - user - ad impressions with no clicks ?
        Handle Imbalance data
            - positive and negative in equal numbers
            - weigh higher for negatives predicted as positives
    DataOps
    Edge vs Cloud
    Learning Modes (offline vs online)
    Inference Modes (Batch vs Online)
    Model Ops

Step 5: Deep dive
    Candidate Generation Model
        classification task
        tune for high recall
