RL - 1
1. Can you go over why value function is a function over P and reward ? reward seems to be a function of P already. what is diff between reward and value ? is reward over time horizon a value.
2. When you are applying bellman equation for blackjack, 
    why is player hand range 4 - 21 and not 2 - 21 ? 
    can you explain the math you did to compute reward vector ?
    how are we computing V ? 
        - started with V is 1 and V_next is 0, why does it converge ?
        - not considering the max V during dot product
